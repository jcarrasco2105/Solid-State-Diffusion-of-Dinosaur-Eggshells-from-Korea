# Solid-State-Diffusion-of-Dinosaur-Eggshells-from-Korea
The stable isotopic composition of dinosaurs eggshells and soil calcites 
from South Korea have been analyzed to determine the body temperature of 
these dinosaurs. Carbonate clumped thermometry is a recently new paleotemperature 
based on measuring the order of  13C and 18O into bonds with each other which makes 
a 13C18O16O2-2 ion. With well perserved eggshells, the analysis will be able to give 
a possible body temperature of the dinosaur. However, the eggshells analyzed are not 
well perserved leading to the discussion of what type of alteration can best explain 
the data.
